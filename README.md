# Project-Azure-Network-Segmentation-with-RBAC-for-Secure-Access-Control

Objective
Create a segmented Azure network with different subnets for application, database, and management layers, using RBAC to control user access to resources within each network layer. 
This project demonstrates secure resource segmentation and precise access control within an Azure environment.

Project Steps:
Set up a Virtual Network with Segmented Subnets
Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Deploy Resources in Each Subnet
Set Up RBAC for Resource Access Control
Assign RBAC Roles
Configure Access Policies for Each Role
Document and Test Access Controls
Document Findings and Challenges
